Python - Object-relational mapping
This project uses object-relational mapper (ORM).
which is a code library that automates the transfer of data stored in relational database tables into objects and classes.
These are more commonly used in application code.
Helps us to perform CRUD operations on databases using pure python code without switching between python and SQL
