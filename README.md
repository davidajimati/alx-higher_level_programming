Excited!!!

This directory contains the first python codes wrote during my software engineering training @Holberton ALX.

In this sprint of the training, it was ensured every code followed the standard python code style (Pycodestyle), every redundant line was checked, every unnecessary line of code was questioned.

It's a nice experience.

Even though I'm this "New" to python, this repo consists of the baby steps we were taught during the bootcamp.

To see my personal python projects (some were built before this, and some after), you can searcch for my "Python_projects" repo.

I do hope you have a nice time going through this repo.

Again?

I'm EXCITED!!!
